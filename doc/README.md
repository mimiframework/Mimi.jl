# README for Mimi documentation

With the exception of ``reference.md`` you can edit all files in this directory to update the documentation.

The file ``reference.md`` in this directory is autogenerated from documentation strings in code files. You can regenerated it by calling the ``builddocs.jl`` script in the src folder. Never edit the file ``reference.md`` by hand because any such change will be deleted once the file is generated again.
